# Monopoly
This is an assignment of my Statistics 102A (Introduction to Computational Statistics with R) class.
This program simulates the classic Monopoly Board Game. However, it does not simulates the entire game, it only tracks the movement of pieces and the squares the pieces land on. It finds out the most-landed squares.
